This will be the place where I take my notes for the game from now on. I really need to remember todo that. I am going to use this time to setup the environment. Currently, I am on the `dev` branch. I want each session to be it's own branch... I should think about that. I think that would be a perfect candidate to put in the **answer that later** category. But I should put that down some where.

- [ ] Get debugging working
- [ ] Push to github
